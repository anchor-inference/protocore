"""Cutting a fresh tool result down to the per-result limit where it enters.

``tool_result_truncation_ratio`` of the window is the most one tool result may
take. Compaction has always enforced it, but only on results outside the
protected tail, and the result a tool has just returned is always inside it: the
newest round is exactly what a pass keeps. So a single oversized output reached
the model whole, and one larger than the window ended the run — the reactive
pass freed nothing, since it may not touch the newest round either.

Here the limit is applied at the moment the result is recorded. What the model
is shown is the head of the output, as much as fits the limit, and a line saying
how much was left out and where the whole value is stored. The whole value is
written to the blob store first, so the reference the line names is real before
anything is cut, and it becomes the result's canonical reference: compaction,
eviction and persistence then treat it as the address of the value rather than
storing it a second time.
